            <article>
                <p>Rainydays was named from the beginning of Kalmar Kommissionsaffär and was founded as early as 1926 in central Kalmar,
                Sweden. At that time it functioned a bit like a pawn shop, but was later developed into a shop for workwear and outdoor
                clothing. In 1999, the store became a full-fledged outdoor store under the name Naturbolaget. In 2002 we also opened
                Naturbolaget in Växjö and in 2005 we started with e-commerce. Now both the e-store and our two physical stores are
                called Outnorth. Our head office and logistics center are now located in Växjö.</p>
                
                <p>Kalmar is a small town in southeastern Sweden and is one of Sweden's oldest cities. Proximity to the Baltic Sea made the
                city an important trading center as early as the 13th century. Both Kalmar and Växjö belong to the province of Småland.
                Typical of Smålan are large areas with forests, lakes and watercourses. Many of the smaller towns in Småland have arisen
                due to agriculture, forestry and glassworks. We Smålanders are often described as inventive, diligent and stingy, but
                the latter we like to replace with sparse.</p>
                
                <p>Ever since the beginning, our focus has been Outdoor from a Scandinavian perspective - call it "The best of Scandinavian
                Outdoor". We choose clothes, shoes and equipment primarily from Nordic brands and based on how we look at Outdoor here
                in the Nordics and Scandinavia.</p>
                
                <p>We want to inspire more people to stay outdoors, because we know that it is good in so many ways. Our mission is "We
                bring happiness to people by taking them outdoors." We can not do this alone, so we collaborate with two of Sweden's
                largest organizations in outdoor life - Friluftsfrämjandet and STF.</p>
                
                <p>In Småland, people are always reminded of the closeness to nature and we are happy to test our products here at home.
                We, like so many others, want to reduce our imprint in nature as much as possible. That's why we work hard on
                sustainability issues and you can read more about how Outnorth works with sustainability here.</p>
                
                <p>As I said, we want to inspire more people to stay outdoors and this is clear in our range selection, our guides and the
                times you are in contact with us at our customer service. We are here for you and hope you will also experience "The
                best of Scandinavian Outdoor"!</p>
